# Badger

A simple app for creating and printing out custom **[Ingress](http://ingress.com) Agent identification badges**. An end-user can fill in their codename, and their level, add a community logo, and a QR code (e.g. link to their community for recruitment), then print the page out.

Currently only supports Enlightened faction. Resistance faction support to come (eventually?).

## Demo

## Community customization

The template can be customized to your community to simplify badge creation for your community members. Fork or clone this repository, checkout the deploy branch, then replace the default logo and QR image files with your own and upload to your webhost.
