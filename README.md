# Badger

A simple app for creating and printing out custom **[Ingress](http://ingress.com) Agent identification badges**. An end-user can fill in their codename, and their level, add a community logo, and a QR code (e.g. link to their community for recruitment), then print the page out.

Once printed, the end-user can simply cut out the front and back, then laminate them back to back in a 57mm x 95mm laminating pouch. A slot punch should be used to allow the badge to be hung on a lanyard or badge clip.

Currently only supports Enlightened faction. Resistance faction support to come (eventually?).

## Community customization

The template can be customized to your community to simplify badge creation for your community members. Fork or clone this repository, checkout the deploy branch, then replace the default logo and QR image files with your own and upload to your webhost.
